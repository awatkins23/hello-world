CSC 430: [Project] GitHub Hello World

## about me
I am currently a first semester senior, but I am behind a semester because I originally started as a biology major with the intention of doing the pre-dental track.  I swapped to computer science in the fall of 2022.  There were three things that made me switch to computer science:
- After ~100 hours of jobshadowing I found out that dentistry wasn't the path I wanted to take
- Other options in the field of biology never made me feel like devoting my life to them
- I have always loved computers
In my first semester at MSU, I had CSC 145 and learned basic Java, and I enjoyed it even though it was particularly easy.  Additionally, it was the only time that I had taken material from school and worked on it during my free time.  I have always been a school-at-school and home-at-home kind of person, but programming has been different for me.  I genuinely enjoy making something work in code.

## experience
Although I haven't been programming nearly as long as most of the CS majors at MSU, even the freshmen, I have started getting some experience with my internship at ITS working software development.  For now, it is mostly fixing small bugs that don't require expansive knowledge of their system, but can still require several files deep of editting.  
On my free time, I haven't coded many full projects because I still haven't found something worth writing.  The two projects I am most proud of are my ChatGPT Translator that works for Android and Windows and a model renderer I made that can display Blender objects to a Java JPanel.  Both of them are not fully completed projects for different reasons, but both helped me learn different concepts.

## future plans
I plan to graduate in Fall of 2024.  Currently, ITS has promised me a job offer after graduation, but I also hope to apply at some bigger name places.  I currently have only worked on backend-type programming, but frontend work seems intriguing to me.  *Google* or *Facebook* would always be awesome places to work, but I would prefer to work somewhere less large and grow with them, so that I am a person, not a number; with size, comes scaling issues.
